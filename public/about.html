<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I played baseball 
  Since I was young and studied worse than others. 
  I only sold baseball as one path. 
</p>

<p>However, with the injury, I felt at a loss and lost motivation. 
  I couldn't play baseball, which I had been doing all my life. 
  So, I didn't stay there for long, but decided to study first and go to college, 
  took the college entrance exam, and confidently entered college.
</p>

<p>
  So, I went to major in computer engineering and 
  I will develop web and apps for many people and become a good developer who will have a positive influence on society!
